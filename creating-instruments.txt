  p4 - for notes; As frequecy if pianoroll mode or numbers from 1 to 16 if pattern mode.
  p5 - (reserved) always 0

Patterns are repeated by the score, until the end of the group duration, each pattern endures 16 seconds, each second is a "hit",
and the instrument must define what to do for each pattern index.
